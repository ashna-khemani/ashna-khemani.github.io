Hello! I am Ashna Khemani, an undergrad studying Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at the University of Pennsylvania. <br><br>
Legos, robots, and IKEA furniture were just some of the things I enjoyed building as a kid in the SF Bay Area. I *love* building things from start to finish, from idea to working model, and learning along the way. <br><br>
Currently, my interests involve robotics, aerospace, entrepreneurship, economics, machine learning, and just messing around with cool ideas as much as possible. <br><br>
I am excited to share more about about myself and some of the projects I've worked on, both in and out of the classroom, through this website. I hope you enjoy, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to say hi ðŸ‘‹! <br><br>
