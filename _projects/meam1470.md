MEAM 1470 was the lab component of my first semester in MEAM at Penn. I explored and demonstrated basic mechanics concepts like kinematics, springs, rotational motion, and collisions.<br><br>
This class was also my first time using MatLab, which has continued to be useful in other coursework and personal projects. The (objectively) coolest tool I used in this class was a motion-capture system in MatLab (created by current and previous instructors and TAs, and implemented by students). <br><br>
As the amount of material from this class was pretty hefty and much of it involved code and other writeups, I am uploading it all to my [meam-1470](https://github.com/ashna-khemani/meam-1470) repo. I will include some videos, photos, and other highlights below (coming soon!).
