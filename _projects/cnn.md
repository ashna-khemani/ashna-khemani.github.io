I'd learned about CNNs through an online machine learning course and found them to be the coolest part. I wanted to learn more, especially because of its applications in interesting areas like robotics, medicine, and climate monitoring.

I like to learn using the Feynman technique (learning by teaching), so I created [this repo](https://github.com/ashna-khemani/cnn-examples) which is essentially a brief tutorial of CNNs and some examples.
