*Robot name origin: "We should name our robot." "What do you mean?" "Like... give it name like Steve or something idk."*

This was my very first step into robotics, where our goal was to make stacks of cones and deposit them in blocked-off corners of the playing field (here's the official [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yo_mlR1VJU&t=79s) with a more complete explanation).<br>
This season was when I first learned to fully appreciate the engineering design process as my team and I tested designed, prototyped, validated, and documented numerous designs. Through constant reiteration and improvement, we finally had a primary design for our robot: Steve.

**Main subsystems and specs:**
- 4-wheel 4-motor powertrain (for more defensive playing)
- 2-motor base lift (holding the big red base cone in right image above)
    - Torque geared to have enough strength to steadily deposit tall cone stacks in the blocked-off zones, without tipping the whole stack over (yes, this has happened to me before)
- 2-motor 3-section linkage (tall extension = tall stacks)
    - Also torque geared as the system was heavy
    - Used a triangle-shaped system of rubber bands to lessen the load on the motors. This would essentially pull two parallel bars of the linkage together, creating a force that pushed the system towards the extended direction.
- 1-motor 1-section linkage (top part of extension, with claw attached)
    - Torque geared? You guessed it!
    - Rubberbands here, too! Helps quicker movement in middle of timed matches.
- 1-motor claw (to grab cones)

Though nerve-wracking at first, I also grew to fully launch myself in the fast-paced, high-stakes, and super fun environment of competitions. Aside from designing, prototyping, validating, and documenting these designs and their software, I also was introduced to the fast-paced, high-stakes, and incredibly fun world of competing.

Though not every day was a win, my team and I definitely saw our hard work pay off. I was incredibly happy with everything I had learned, experienced, and achieved. I could only come back for another season, but aiming higher than before...
