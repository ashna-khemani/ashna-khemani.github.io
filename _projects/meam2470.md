Whew! Lots happened in this class, as it was the lab complement for both my statics and thermal-fluids classes. Sure, I could use the equations in class and ace the exams, but it was much more thought-provoking to use them *analytically* here to **design** systems and **explain why** things happened the way they did in the real world. <br><br>

Below is my final portfolio from this class – a quick rundown and reflection of major assignments. Professor Kothmann is an incredibly fun professor, so the presentation is a little lighthearted at times (case in point: the title slide).
