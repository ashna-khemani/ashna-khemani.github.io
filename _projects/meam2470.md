Whew! Lots happened in this class, as it was the lab complement for both my statics and thermal-fluids classes. Sure, I could use the equations in class and ace the exams, but it was much more thought-provoking to use them *analytically* here to **design** systems and **explain why** things happened the way they did in the real world. <br><br>
A memorable part of this course was taking a field trip to Penn Park, where we analyze the frame system of the railway bridge that went through it.<br><br>
We also made our own bridge, with both performance and cost in mind. (I do have a slight feeling that our group tried to optimize cost a little much... hmm.)<br><br>
Another fun challenge design was making a tension strap, where we were again tasked with finding a balance between cost optimization and performance given some design constraints. This assignment was also my first introduction to FEA in SolidWorks, which I used to verify my design.

(Fear not, more content and photos are coming soon! Once I recover the photos from my phone.)
