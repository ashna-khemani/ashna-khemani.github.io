This class was my introduction to SolidWorks, a step up from the pen-and-paper designs I'd done since middle school. Most of the assignments in this class were to be laser-cut from MDF or acrylic, or 3D printed. I had to design not only for looks and functionality, but also consider how I would fabricate each part, and possibly change the design based on that. <br><br>
All in all, this was one of the most fun and rewarding classes I have taken at Penn! It was cool seeing my creations come to life, but I also picked up skills that have been valuable to my other experiences. (If you're a current/incoming Quaker, I *highly* recommend this class, even if you're not in MEAM... or Engineering at all!) <br><br>
I will be featuring notable projects below.

### Puzzle Cube {#puzzlecube}
*Click <a href="/assets/projectfiles/puzzleCube.zip" download>here</a> to download project zip file.*

One of my first assignments was creating a 3x3x3 puzzle cube, with Parts for each piece, an Assembly of the complete puzzle, and engineering Drawings of each part.<br>
**Skills learned:**
- Creating Parts using sketches and extrusions
- Creating an assembly with multiple parts, using basic mates
- Exploded views
- Engineering drawing conventions

### Piston {#piston}
*Click <a href="/assets/projectfiles/piston.zip" download>here</a> to download project zip file.*

For this project, I was shown a video of a simple CNC-machined piston. I then had to create a working model (Solidworks Assembly) of it.<br>
**Skills learned:**
- Physical object to CAD
- More complex mates
- Moving assembly to simulate motion

### Siege Machine {#siege}

The course culminated in a tournament of siege machines, built in teams of 2-4. The "army" of machines that could shoot bouncy balls to knock down more of the other's wall of building blocks was the winner. The machine I built was inspired by a pinball launcher.

Here is a <a href = "https://youtube.com/shorts/64cm6nPIsHQ?feature=share">video</a> of it launching a projectile. Our maximum range was around 12 feet.
