This class was my evolution from simple pen-and-paper design sketches that I was used to from my time competing in VEX: I learned how to use SolidWorks for the first time. Most of the assignments were to be laser-cut from MDF or acrylic, or 3D printed. I had to design not only for looks and functionality, but also consider how I would fabricate each part, and possibly change the design based on that. <br><br>
All in all, this was one of the most fun and rewarding classes I have taken at Penn! It was cool seeing my creations come to life, but I also picked up skills that have been valuable to my other experiences. (If you're a current/incoming Quaker, I *highly* recommend this class, even if you're not in MEAM... or Engineering at all!) <br><br>
I will be featuring some of my work from this class below.
